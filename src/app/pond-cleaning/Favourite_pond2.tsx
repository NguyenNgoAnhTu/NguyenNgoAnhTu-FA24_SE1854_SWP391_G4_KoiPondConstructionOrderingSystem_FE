            Anyone who owns a pond in Ann Arbor knows that they require regular maintenance to stay healthy and functioning properly. One of the most important things you can do for your pond is to have an exploratory drain and clean performed regularly.

            <Typography className="text-[#2B2825] text-[16px]">
            This pond maintenance process involves draining all the water from the pond so that it can be thoroughly cleaned. This gives you a chance to inspect the liner for any damage, remove debris and ensure that the pump is working properly.

            <Typography className="text-[#2B2825] text-[16px]">
            Although it may seem like a lot of work, an exploratory drain and clean is essential for keeping your pond healthy and looking its best. Furthermore, it can help to prevent serious problems from developing in the future.
